Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain, allowing it to "learn" from large amounts of data.

Applications of AI

AI is used in many applications including:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Healthcare diagnostics
- Financial trading
- Autonomous vehicles

The Future of AI

The future of AI is promising, with potential applications in virtually every industry. As AI continues to evolve, it will become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, from smart homes to personalized medicine.
